# pepper-android
A library that wraps some relevant Qi-APIs and simplifies these by abstraction layers. This library is under heavy development!

## setup 
Before you can use this lib on your Pepper you have to [jailbreak](https://github.com/LilithWittmann/pepper-tablet-jailbreak) them. Afterwards you can download the [Pepper SDK for Android Studio] (https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/us-en/downloads/pepper) and add this lib to your project.

## example

```java

// create a new pepper session
PepperSession pepper = new PepperSession();
pepper.connect();

final Say say = new Say(pepper);
        
// say something
say.say("Welcome to Pepper Android");
       

say.setLanguage(say.LANGUAGE_GERMAN).andThen(new FutureFunction<Object, Object>(){
	@Override
	public Future<Object> execute(Future<Object> future) throws Exception {
		say.say("Wilkommen bei Pepper f√ºr Android");
		return null;
	}
});

```
